Hot melt adhesives exist in solid form and are classified by different types of raw materials. Polyurethane (Polyurethane Hot Melt Adhesive) is a reactive type of hot melt adhesive for the base material. After cooling, there will be a chemical cross-linking reaction. Rubber-based pressure-sensitive hot melt adhesives are mainly used in packaging, labels ,metal back stickers and so on.

Reactive types of hot melt adhesives can bond a variety of substrates, including some difficult-to-bond plastics. These adhesives can handle all walks of life’s toughest bonding applications. The hot melt adhesives is the best choose of high-speed processing, bonding diversity, large gap filling, rapid initial strength and less shrinkage.

DeepMaterial reactive types of hot melt adhesives have many advantages: the open time ranges from seconds to minutes, did’t need the fixtures, long-term durability and excellent moisture resistance, chemical resistance, oil resistance and temperature resistance. DeepMaterial’s reactive types of hot melt adhesive products are solvent-free.

# DeepMaterial Main Advantages of Hot Melt Adhesive

### Advantages of hot melt adhesive:
· High production efficiency (shorter curing time)
· Easy to realize the automate the process
· Combines adhesive and sealant properties

### Advantages of pressure sensitive hot melt adhesive:
· Long-lasting stickiness
· Self-adhesive coating
· Coating and assembly can be separated

### Advantages of reactive polyurethane hot melt adhesive:
· Low application temperature
· Long opening hours
· Quick curing

## Temperature Resistance
Hot melt adhesives of different systems have different temperature resistance ranges.

## Bonding Different Substrates
Different systems of hot melt adhesives have different adhesion to polar or non-polar substrates, and are suitable for bonding different substrates. Such as various plastics, metal and wood and paper.

## Chemical Resistance
Different systems of hot melt adhesives have different resistance to chemical media.

## Bonding Strength
Thermoplastic hot melt adhesives can gain ultimate strength immediately after cooling. They soften again when the temperature rises. Moisture-curing polyurethane hot-melt adhesive exists in thermosetting form after absorbing moisture and cross-linking, and the cured polyurethane hot-melt adhesive cannot be melted anymore.
